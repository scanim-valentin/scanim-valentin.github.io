                    The goal of this app is to allow users on a same network to communicate in a decentralized fashion
                    while
                    enabling the possibility to access their conversation history.

                    My contribution to this experimental work was part of a larger "initiation to research" ambitious

                    project. It aimed at creating a privacy focused "level-2" online social network
                    <b>Android app in Java</b>.
                    It involves exchanging links to message content stored and encrypted on a private Dropbox cloud
                    storage
                    over an already existing social network (Reddit) by using steganography.

                    My team was in charge of implementing the encryption layer between the user and cloud storage.

                    learn basic AI concepts. <br/>
                    The goal is to find the correct parameters, symbolized by the LED rings
                    changing their respective colors as the player turns each rotary
                    encoders. Let these parameters be found, the device manages
                    to categorize each element of a set of labeled card containing
                    RFID chips.

                    It uses BeautifulSoup to convert SVG content to set of labeled dots of different sizes and colors
                    and TKinter to represent and link these dots by clicking on them.<br/>
