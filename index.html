                This work was made in assembly language with Cortex M3 instruction set via ARM's Keil and runs on STM32. The goal was to implement real time FFT for laser detection of specific wavelenghts and PWM for playing sound.

                    I was in charge of implementing random effects for each type of block as well as terrain generation based on an hard-coded ASCII description. <br/>
